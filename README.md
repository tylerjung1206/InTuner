# InTuner
Welcome to my files for InTuner!

- To see the finalized code for the embedded system, check out main.cpp (located in final_code/src/main.cpp)
- To see my schematic, PCB, and CAD files, check out the schematic:pcb:cad folder. (You may need Eagle and Fusion installed to open them). An image for the manufacturer for the PCB is also there as a png file.
